# Ising model
Implementation of the classical Ising model with a Wolff-Cluster update algorithm

The Ising model is one of the most researched statistical models. The exact solution for the order parameter (magnetization) as a function of the temperature is known, thus one can easily test the accuracy of new algorithms on it.
